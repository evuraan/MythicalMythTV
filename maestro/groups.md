# Groups (Display)

`maestro` now organizes the recordings into groups (i.e. titles or records).

While this does not break backward compatibility, update your maestro to the latest version to get the best experience.

Three buttons provides the sorting functionality.

1. The `Left` button groups all your recordings in alphabetical order.
2. The `Right` button expands each title and shows the available recordings in that title in chronological order.
3. The `Options` or `Start` button shows all available recordings in chronological order.

You can switch between these layouts at any time to suit your preferences. The `Left` button is the default layout.
